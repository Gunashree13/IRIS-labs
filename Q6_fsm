//In this code, the FSM has four states (S0, S1, S2, S3) and a state register state to keep track of the current state. The input sample represents the input sequence of samples, and the output detect is set to 1 when more than one occurrence of 0's is detected.
//The FSM transitions to different states based on the current state and the input sample values.

//The testbench provides a clock signal (clk) and sequences of input samples (samples) to observe the behavior of the FSM. 
//The FSM will detect the occurrence of more than one 0 in a sequence of 3 samples and set the detect signal accordingly.

//You can simulate this code using a Verilog simulator
//to verify the functionality of the FSM for detecting more than one occurrence of 0's in a sequence of 3 samples.
